# Getting Started

## Required Software

### Git

To learn what Git is, please read [this article on GitHub's website](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/).
Get Git from [the official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Java

Even if you have the Java Runtime Environment already, you should get the Java Development Kit.
You can get the latest version from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

### IntelliJ IDEA

We highly recommend that you use IntelliJ IDEA for programming for Star Legacy.
Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSKERVTMWqs) to get an overview of IntelliJ IDEA.
Download it [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=linux).

## Cloning the Repository

- Open Git Bash.

- Use `cd` to go to the directory that you want to keep it in.
If you don't know, I'd recommend `cd Documents`.

- Run this command: `git clone https://github.com/MicleBrick/SLPlugins`

> *Note*: We recommend using SSH keys instead of signing in manually.
> Otherwise, every time you upload/download changes, you may need to sign in to GitHub.
> See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
> for how to set up SSH.
>
> If you do use SSH keys, instead of the URL above, you would do `git clone git@github.com:MicleBrick/SLPlugins.git`.

- Once it finishes cloning, open IntelliJ IDEA.

- Click "Open or Import" (if you already have a project open, then File -> Open...)

- Navigate to the SLPlugins folder and select it

With those steps, you should have a working clone of the repository.
You may need to wait for IDEA to download dependencies and index before working on the code.
